What are the requirements for this password generator?

What do I need to track in the webpage?
variables - length of the password (at least 8 characters but no more than 128), lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric values, special characters.

the button needs to be functional, look into connecting the button in the html via js?
Button is already connected, just needed to provide properties for it to generate. 

needs prompts for password criteria (ask what they mean by "password Criteria"? how is that different from )

prompt for password criteria - password must include at least 8 characters and no more than 128 character
prompt for exceeding the length - password cannot be more than 128 characters - invalid input
confirm for - lowercase, uppercase, special, number


need alert message once the password is generated.

create variable (containsLower);

var containsLower = confirm ("Would you like to include lowercase characters?");

create variable (containsUpper);

var containsUpper = confirm("Would you like to include uppercase characters?");

create variable (containsNumbers)

var containsNumbers = confirm("Would you like to include numbers?")

create variable (containsSpecial)

var containsSpecial = confirm("Would you like to include special characters?")

create if statements 

if (containsLower) {
    temp = temp.concat(chars.lower);
}
if (conatinsUpper) {
    temp = temp.concat(chars.upper);
}
if (containsNumbers) {
    temp = temp.concat(chars.numbers);
}
if (containsSpecial) {
    temp = temp.concat(chars.special);
}
