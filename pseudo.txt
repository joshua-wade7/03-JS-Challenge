What are the requirements for this password generator?

What do I need to track in the webpage?
variables - length of the password (at least 8 characters but no more than 128), lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric values, special characters.

the button needs to be functional, look into connecting the button in the html via js. 

needs prompts for password criteria (ask what they mean by "password Criteria"? how is that different from )

prompt for length - password must be 8 characters in length
prompt for exceeding the length - password cannot be more than 128 characters
prompt for what character types - list one example of each character types


need a confirm message after each type of character to include has been executed, to state what they selected and then an 

need alert message once the password is generated.




create variable (containsNumbers)

var containsNumbers = confirm("Would you like to include numbers?")

create variable (containsSpecial)

var containsSpecial = confirm("Would you like to include special characters?")

create if statement (containsNumbers)
